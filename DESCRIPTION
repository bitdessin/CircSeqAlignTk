Description: 
    CircSeqAlignTk is an end-to-end toolkit for RNA-Seq data analysis of
    circular genome sequences, supporting tasks from alignment to visualization.
    It is primarily designed for studying viroids, which are small, circular RNAs
    typically composed of a few hundred nucleotides.
    In addition to analysis capabilities, CircSeqAlignTk provides a streamlined
    interface for generating synthetic RNA-Seq data that closely mimics real datasets.
    This functionality enables developers to benchmark alignment tools,
    test novel alignment algorithms, and validate new workflows.
    This vignette offers an overview of CircSeqAlignTk and demonstrates its usage.
