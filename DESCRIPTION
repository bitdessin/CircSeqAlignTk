Description: 
    CircSeqAlignTk is designed for end-to-end RNA-Seq data analysis
    of circular genome sequences, from alignment to visualization.
    It mainly targets viroids which are composed of 246-401 nt circular RNAs.
    In addition, CircSeqAlignTk implements a tidy interface
    to generate synthetic sequencing data that mimic real RNA-Seq data,
    allowing developers to evaluate the performance of alignment tools
    and workflows.
